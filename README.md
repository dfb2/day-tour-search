# Glósur Erlings

Í Netbeans er hægt að skilgreina svona variables og hægrismella á bakgrunn og velja Refactor -> Encapsulate Fields, og búa til getters og setters.
T.d. gæti maður búið til getters fyrir alla þessa en bara setter fyrir info

```Java
private final String name, location , ceo, email, password;
private String info;
```

# Version history
* 0.1 - Prints out sample lines in database. 

* 0.2 - Possible to peform basic search in database (future release). 

# The day tour search engine
Search engine for day tours offered in Iceland. Availability-based booking with hotel pickup option. Created in the course Software Development (HBV401G). 
# Branching model for Git
The plan is to use a simplified version of GitFlow as a branching model for git. 
[About GitFlow](https://datasift.github.io/gitflow/IntroducingGitFlow.html)

As well as using this model we use: 
* git revert instead of git reset. 
* git merge instead of git rebase.

* We have a master branch, dev (development) branch
and feature / hotfix branches off of the dev branch
* The master branch only has release ready versions of the app. 
The idea is the commits track the app between sprints. So one
commit for sprint 1 and then the next commit for sprint 2. 
## The general workflow for git
* Create a feature / hotfix branch off of the dev branch. 
Develop feature / fix bug. 
* When finished, check out to dev branch and merge dev branch into feature branch.
Resolve any conflicts. 
* Push your branch to the remote branch of the same name. 
* Create a pull request and assign reviewers. 
* Merge with the dev branch. 
* When all features for a particular sprint have been implemented,
merge with the master branch. 

These concepts and more useful git commands are covered in a fun game on git branching
(which could also be used for illustrative purposes):
